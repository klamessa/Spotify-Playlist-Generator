# Spotify-Playlist-Generator

Overview
The Spotify Playlist Generator is a command-line program written in Python that allows users to generate a curated playlist based on up to four artist names. The program interacts with the Spotify API through the Spotipy library to search for the artists' unique Spotify IDs and create a playlist using those IDs. The generated playlist is then displayed in the terminal.
